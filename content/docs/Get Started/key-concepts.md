## Core concepts
It's important to understand several core concepts before getting started:
- **Incidents are the atom of Atlos.** [They're](/docs/incidents/incidents) the core unit of content and include one or more pieces of source material. 
- **You can upload or archive source material.** To add [source material](/docs/incidents/source-material)—like photos, videos, or websites—you can upload files or use our automatic web archival system.
- **Projects are the unit of investigations.** To begin an investigation, create a [project](/docs/investigations/projects) and [share](/docs/investigations/collaboration) it with your team. 

## Collaborating
All data on Atlos is private by default. To collaborate, first share your investigation by adding collaborators usernames on the Access page. 

## Importing investigations
If you'd like to move an investigation from a spreadsheet on Atlos, create a new project, navigate to its Manage page, and [bulk import](/docs/investigations/import-and-export-data#data-import) a CSV.
