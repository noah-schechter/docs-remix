## Core concepts
Welcome to Atlos! It's important to understand several core concepts before getting started:
- **Incidents are the atom of Atlos.** [They're](/docs/incidents) the core unit of content and include one or more pieces of source material. 
- **You can upload or archive source material.** To add [source material](/docs/source-material)—like photos, videos, or websites—you can upload files or use our automatic web archival system.
- **Projects are the unit of investigations.** To begin an investigation, create a [project](/docs/projects) and [share](/docs/collaboration) it with your team. 

## Collaborating
All data on Atlos is private by default. To collaborate, first share your investigation by adding collaborators usernames on the Access page. 

## Workflow 
Use [status](/docs/metadata#status) to collaborate on Atlos. All incidents begin as Unclaimed. When you start working on an incident, mark its status as In Progress. Once its ready for verification, mark it as Ready for Review. If you're coordinating investigation, flag incidents taht you've verified as Complete—this will seal the underlying data. Use the Queue page of each project to find incidents of a particular status. 

## Importing investigations
If you'd like to move an investigation from a spreadsheet on Atlos, create a new project, navigate to its Manage page, and [bulk import](/docs/import-and-export-data#data-import) a CSV.
